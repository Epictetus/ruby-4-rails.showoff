# Ruby 4 Rails

## About this presentation

**FRIEND**: Hey Simone, I want to start learning Rails.

**ME**: Really?

**FRIEND**: You know, I have been working in PHP and Symfony for a while and now I want to try something new.

**ME**: That's cool.

**FRIEND**: Could you help me studying Rails?

**ME**: Sure. But if you really want to learn Rails, you need to start from Ruby.

**FRIEND**: I worked with PHP and several other languages. Is Ruby really that difficult?

**ME**: Learning the Ruby syntax is not that difficult. Thinking like a Rubyist is the real challenge. If you really want to appreciate Ruby, you must understand the Ruby ecosystem and the philosophy behind the language.

**FRIEND**: Ok. Could you teach me that?

**ME**: I can start giving you some directions, then you'll have to start working on it.

**ME**: I'm going to prepare a brief introduction to Ruby. I'll try to extract the most important features of the language, keeping an eye on Rails since that is your ultimate goal.

**FRIEND**: Cool. How long it will take.

**ME**: Let's schedule one full day. I'll show you the presentation and we'll start digging into Ruby. At the end, we'll try to summarize everything by giving a look at Rack and creating a small MVC application using the awesome Sinatra framework. It is not Rails, but it's definitely a good starting point. We can't concentrate too much concepts into a single session.

**FRIEND**: I agree.

**FRIEND**: See you on Saturday, I can't wait to start playing with Ruby.


This is *that* presentation. **Enjoy Ruby!**
